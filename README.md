## Description
This project contains an command line tool which has been programmed with Python. It can be accessed by executing:
```BASH
python bikeshare.py
```
This tool is a result of the second project of the Nanodegree *Data Science with Python* by Udacity.

You can analyse bike sharing data from three different cities in the US and you will have the opporutinity to define the scope of analysis. You can either pick a certain month, year, both or anaylse all available data. The statitics you are going to be provide covers time statistics as well as statistics specific to the users of the bikesharing service. Further you have the opportunity to examine the raw data in chunks of 5 entries.

Python version used: 3.10.6
### Files used
There are generally three datasets that are needed to use this analysis tool:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

You can get these .csv files under the "Download resources" pane in the context of the second project "Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data".

### Credits
This project has been created as part of the Nanodegree Data Science with Python by Udacity.
Hence, the overall idea and the data set belong to Udacity.#SECTION III: ADDITIONAL CHANGES 1!
